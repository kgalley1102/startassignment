What I learned in the start assignment

In this start assignment I learned how you create a new repository. I could not figure out where that button was and I realized it's the little plus next to your name. I also learned that the pull requests are a way of communication about the projects you have created for feedback. There is still A LOT I am trying to figure out with github. Since it is all new to me I am not suprised that I am having a very difficult time trying to understand these concepts right away. I hope I am doing this right.
